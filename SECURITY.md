# Security policy

DISCLAIMER!
* This is personally maintained opensource project. Best effort will be made to support its security and resiliency but as per license, no warranty.
* As deployment role for ansible, vulnerability for ansible, targeted deployed software(s) or underlying operating system(s) won't be accepted. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure those are maintained appropriately and in non-vulnerable versions.
* I believe in transparency. Considering the scope of project, it is less likely that a security issue would be a major impact and full disclosure should not be an issue but if you believe otherwise, use the web form.

## Security bulletins
